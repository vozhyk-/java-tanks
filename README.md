##User Guide

###run server

###run client

####Main menu

In main menu player should connect to game server. By default IP is set up to `127.0.0.1`. Hostname
may be used instead of IP address. To connect, one should press return. If connection is successful
`New game` and `Random game` buttons will be enabled. `Random game` finds random game available on
the server and joins it, otherwise returns an error. `New game` creates new game on the server and
joins to it.

####Lobby

In lobby player may set number of bots that will be added to game, map width and map type. Pressing
`ready` button sets `Ready` state. When all players in the lobby are ready the game starts.

####Game

When it's player's turn to shoot the buttons are enabled. To choose angle one can use `up` and
`down` arrow keys, buttons or simply by clicking on the map. Power of the shot is set by `left`
and `right` arrow keys or buttons. `shoot` button or `enter` key makes tank shoot. When there is
only one tank left the game ends and [scoreboard](#scoreboard) is displayed.

####Scoreboard

List of all players is displayed with information who won and lost. Here the user can return to
[main menu](#main-menu) using `return` button.
